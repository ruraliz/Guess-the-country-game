Future Improvements


Given more time I would improve the game by implementing:


- a way that if the player guesses correctly they can move on to next flag 

- Since the player can click on answer multiple times a rack-up points, I would find way to disable that

- Have the flags/multiple-Choices show-up in a random fashion in a loop, each appearing in a specific spot on the screen.
